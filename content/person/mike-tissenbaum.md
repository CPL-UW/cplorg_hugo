description = "Mike Tissenbaum is a postdoctoral researcher at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery and Complex Play Lab (University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison), where he advances research on learning environments that merge physical and digital spaces to provide new ways for children to collaboratively develop engineering, science, and computational literacies. In this work, Mike has developed immersive technology-rich learning environments in which students have taken on the role of animals that need to physically explore their habitat for food; acted as engineers to help biologists discover new forms of aquatic life; and collectively explored the physics of hollywood movies. Mike's work has gained recognition internationally, receiving awards both for his academic research and museum exhibit design."
